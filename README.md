# Swansea Covid Model

Welcome to the repository for the Swansea Covid Model. We, the Swansea Modelling Team, used it to generate projections for the Welsh Government. 

Please note that this public repository is currently under construction. We expect that we will be able to make the code available by the end of September 2023.
